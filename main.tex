\section{Problem Domain}

\subsection{Background and Context}
The housing and rental markets rely on traditional methods for background checks, manual paperwork, delayed emails, and brief spreadsheets. These outdated methods lead to inefficiency, data inconsistencies, and poor property manager & tenant experience. Due to the lack of a centralized digital system, it is sometimes difficult to track maintenance requests, manage payments, and produce accurate financial reports for taxation.   

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current condition of property management is affected by the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inefficient methods for collecting and tracking rental agreements.
    \item Miscommunication between the landlord and the tenants.
    \item Manual maintenance request system.
    \item Ineffective financial reporting and documentation.
    \item Absence of role-based access control for different user types.

\end{itemize}
These problems lead to increased operational expenses, postponed services, tenant dissatisfaction, and revenue loss. An integrated system is required to simplify the process of a property management system.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholders impacted by these problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Landlords/Property Managers}: Need for streamlined tools to manage tenants, track leases, automate rent collection, and oversee maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Tenants}: Need for transparency, timely maintenance responses, and easy payment options.
    \item \textbf{Accounting and Finance Personnel}: Access to accurate financial data, automated reporting, and tax compliance support.
    \item \textbf{System Administrators}: Manage user roles, access rights, and ensure secure configuration of the platform.
\end{itemize}
