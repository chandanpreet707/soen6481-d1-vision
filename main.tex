\section{Problem Domain}

\subsection{Background and Context}
The housing and rental markets rely on traditional methods for background checks, manual paperwork, delayed emails, and brief spreadsheets. These outdated methods lead to inefficiency, data inconsistencies, and poor property manager & tenant experience. Due to the lack of a centralized digital system, it is sometimes difficult to track maintenance requests, manage payments, and produce accurate financial reports for taxation.   

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current condition of property management is affected by the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inefficient methods for collecting and tracking rental agreements.
    \item Miscommunication between the landlord and the tenants.
    \item Manual maintenance request system.
    \item Ineffective financial reporting and documentation.
    \item Absence of role-based access control for different user types.

\end{itemize}
These problems lead to increased operational expenses, postponed services, tenant dissatisfaction, and revenue loss. An integrated system is required to simplify the process of a property management system.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholders impacted by these problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Landlords/Property Managers}: Need for streamlined tools to manage tenants, track leases, automate rent collection, and oversee maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Tenants}: Need for transparency, timely maintenance responses, and easy payment options.
    \item \textbf{Accounting and Finance Personnel}: Access to accurate financial data, automated reporting, and tax compliance support.
    \item \textbf{System Administrators}: Manage user roles, access rights, and ensure secure configuration of the platform.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution Domain}

\subsection{Product Vision}
CanaLease(CA) will be a web-based platform, accessible from any device, built by keeping in mind the requirements of landlords, tenants, finance staff, and administrators. The goal for building this web app is to reduce manual work, improve communication, and make day-to-day property management tasks faster and more reliable. The system will work and be protected by a secure web interface and scalable database for future upgrades. It will support both small landlords and larger companies in managing a few units to multiple buildings.  

\subsection{Key Features}
The system will include the following core features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Online Rent Payments:} Tenants can pay rent securely online; landlords can track payments and send reminders for late payments.
    \item \textbf{Lease and Tenant Management:} Landlords can create, upload, and manage lease agreements, and track lease start/end dates.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Request System:} Tenants can submit maintenance issues by filling online forms, attaching photos; landlords/managers can assign workers and track status easily.
    \item \textbf{Financial Reports:} Generates monthly and yearly reports for income, expenses, and tax filing.
    \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control:} Each user (tenant, landlord, accountant, admin) will have access only to what they need.
    \item \textbf{Notifications and Reminders:} Automatic emails or SMS for rent due, lease renewals, or pending maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Multi-language Support:} English and French language web interface to support Canadian users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits and Impact}
This web-application (CanaLease) will help in reducing dependency on paperwork, minimizing response times, providing users transparency in various property management operations. Landlords will spend less time in managing documents, and tracking rentals. Tenants will have smoother experience with reliable support. Finance teams will have access to organized records for financial reporting. Overall, the whole system will improve trust, interaction, and satisfaction between landlords and tenants, also in saving time and avoiding errors.  

\section{Stakeholders and Users}
CanaLease (CA) is built by keeping in mind the requirements of a wide range of users, providing an interactive, easy-to-use, and adaptive user interface (UI) while performing complex operations seamlessly. Below is a breakdown of the main user types and their needs.

\section{Creativity and Critical Thinking}

CanaLease (CA) is designed with Canadian users in mind. It handles all basic property managements tasks, while providing additional features like: 

\subsection{Support for Bilingual Users}
Since Canada has two official languages, the system will support both English and French. Users can switch between language through interactive User Interface(UI) based on their preference.

\subsection{Seasonal Maintenance Reminders}
Properties in Canada often deal with seasonal issues like snow removal, heating system checks, or frozen pipes. CanaLease will include built-in reminders and templates for seasonal maintenance to help landlords stay ahead of weather-related problems.

\subsection{Eviction and Legal Notice Tools}
In some provinces, legal steps must be followed for evictions or rent increases. CanaLease can include province-specific templates and reminders to help landlords follow local regulations properly.

\subsection{Scalability for Multi-Unit and Multi-Property Management}
While small landlords may manage a few units, larger companies could manage dozens of buildings. CanaLease is designed to scale — allowing users to switch between properties, group units by building, and manage different portfolios under one account.

\subsection{Possible Future Enhancements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with government services for tax reporting
    \item Mobile app for quicker access
    \item AI-based rent price recommendations based on location and market trends
    \item Chat feature between tenant and landlord within the app
\end{itemize}

These features aren’t just extra — they show how CanaLease can grow into a full platform that fits Canadian laws, user habits, and future expectations.
