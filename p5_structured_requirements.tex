\section*{Instructions}
This activity focuses on transforming loosely defined, natural language requirements into disciplined ones by attaching measurable fit criteria. Each fit criterion makes the requirement verifiable and testable.

\section*{Specification and Fit Criteria Table}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.47\textwidth} p{0.47\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Specification} & \textbf{Fit Criterion} \\
\midrule

Trains should run at high frequency during rush hours.

\addlinespace

In order to ensure comfortable transportation, trains should accelerate/decelerate smoothly. 
&
Acceleration should not exceed 1.2 m/s\textsuperscript{2}, and deceleration should not exceed 1.4 m/s\textsuperscript{2}, measured under normal load and track conditions. \\
\addlinespace

Meetings should be scheduled as quickly as possible once they are initiated.
